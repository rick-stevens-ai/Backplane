Back Off! I just backed up methane.log to ./#methane.log.1#
Reading file methane.tpr, VERSION 2025.4-Homebrew (single precision)
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 0 steps

Back Off! I just backed up methane.trr to ./#methane.trr.1#

Back Off! I just backed up methane.edr to ./#methane.edr.1#

Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  1.00000e+01
   Number of steps    =            0

Energy minimization reached the maximum number of steps before the forces
reached the requested precision Fmax < 10.

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up methane.gro to ./#methane.gro.2#

Steepest Descents did not converge to Fmax < 10 in 1 steps.
Potential Energy  =  4.3860714e+01
Maximum force     =  2.4978870e+03 on atom 3
Norm of force     =  2.2341728e+03
