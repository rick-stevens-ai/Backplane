                 :-) GROMACS - gmx grompp, 2025.4-Homebrew (-:

Executable:   /opt/homebrew/bin/../Cellar/gromacs/2025.4/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /opt/homebrew/bin/../Cellar/gromacs/2025.4
Working dir:  /Users/stevens/Dropbox/Backplane/APPS/test_runs/methane/gromacs
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f methane.mdp -c methane.gro -p methane.top -o methane.tpr


NOTE 1 [file methane.mdp]:
  For a correct single-point energy evaluation with nsteps = 0, use
  continuation = yes to avoid constraining the input coordinates.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

NOTE 2 [file methane.top, line 31]:
  Zero-step energy minimization will alter the coordinates before
  calculating the energy. If you just want the energy of a single point,
  try zero-step MD (with unconstrained_start = yes). To do multiple
  single-point energy evaluations of different configurations of the same
  topology, use mdrun -rerun.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 12.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 3 [file methane.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.



There were 3 NOTEs

Back Off! I just backed up methane.tpr to ./#methane.tpr.1#
