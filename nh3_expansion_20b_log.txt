User Request: Based on the following NH3 formation catalyst candidates we've already identified:

  1. Pyridine (c1ccncc1) - N-heterocycle ligand, Lewis base
  2. Imidazole (c1cnc[nH]1) - Enzyme-inspired, proton shuttle
  3. 2,2'-Bipyridine (c1ccnc(c1)c2ccccn2) - Bidentate chelator
  4. Ammonia (N) - Product molecule
  5. Hydrazine (NN) - N-N bond intermediate
  6. Pyrazole (c1c[nH]nc1) - Imidazole isomer
  7. 1,2,4-Triazole (c1ncn[nH]1) - Three N atoms for N2 activation

Using chemical reasoning, suggest 15 NEW molecules that would be promising for NH3 formation catalysis. Consider:

1. **Nitrogen-containing ligands** that could coordinate to metal centers (Ru, Fe, Mo, Re)
2. **Proton shuttles** and bases that facilitate H+ transfer
3. **Molecules with multiple coordination sites** for binding N2, H2, or intermediates 
4. **Systematic variations** of molecules above (substituted pyridines, different heterocycles)
5. **Biomimetic structures** inspired by nitrogenase (FeMo-cofactor has imidazole from histidine)

For each molecule provide:
- SMILES notation (verify it's valid!)
- Name
- Brief rationale (1-2 sentences explaining why it's good for NH3 catalysis)

Format as:
1. SMILES | Name | Rationale
2. SMILES | Name | Rationale
...

Focus on diversity and chemical logic. Avoid duplicating molecules already listed above.
